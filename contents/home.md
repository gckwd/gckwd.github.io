#### Biography

My name is Cankun Guo. a third-year student in the Artificial Intelligence Experimental Class at Nanchang University. I am deeply passionate about large language models, multimodal learning, and AI infrastructure (AI Infra), with a strong interest in exploring the potential of these cutting-edge technologies in both academic research and practical applications.

#### Research Interests

My current passion revolves around advancing **EFFICIENT** and **ROBUST** AI systems for multimodal learning and large language models (<strong style="color:red;">Now I am focusing on multimodal representation learning and scalable AI infrastructure</strong>), this includes:

1. **Multimodal Learning Systems**  
   - *Cross-Modal Alignment*: Develop methods to effectively align features from diverse modalities (e.g., vision and text), with a focus on preserving modality-specific expertise. 
   - *Efficient Multimodal Training*: Design scalable training strategies for multimodal models, such as progressive training to enhance generalization and prevent mode collapse.  
   - *Applications*: Leverage multimodal learning for tasks like visual question answering and cross-modal retrieval.

2. **Large Language Models (LLM) & AI Infrastructure**  
   - *Scalable LLM Training*: Optimize training pipelines for large-scale language models, focusing on efficient resource utilization and faster convergence. Example includes studying systems like [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed).  
   - *Long-Context Processing*: Explore techniques for efficient long-context inference in LLMs, such as attention mechanism optimizations.  
   - *AI Infra for LLMs*: Build robust infrastructure to support the deployment and fine-tuning of foundation models, with an emphasis on parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA.
